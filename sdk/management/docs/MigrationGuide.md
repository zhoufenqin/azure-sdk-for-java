## Guide for migrating to `com.azure.resourcemanager.**` from `com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`

This document is intended for users that are familiar with an older version of the Java SDK for managment libraries (`com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`) ad wish to migrate their application 
to the next version of Azure resource management libraries (`com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`)

For users new to the Java SDK for resource management libraries, please see the [README for 'com.azure.resourcemanager.*`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/management)

## Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above.

## Updated Maven dependencies

The latest dependencies for resource management libraries are [available here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/management).

## General Changes

The latest Azure Java SDK for management libraries is a result of our efforts to create a client library that is user-friendly and idiomatic to the Java ecosystem.

Apart from redesigns resulting from the [new Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/management/docs/DESIGN.md), the latest version improves on several areas from old version.

### Converting core classes

List all the core class changes and list 

| In old version (`com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`) | Equivalent in new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`) | Sample Link |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                                                |                                                            |     [link to existing sample](/)        |
|                                                |                                                            |             |
|                                                |                                                            |             |

### Authentication

To provide an unified authentication based on Azure Identity for all Azure Java SDKs, the authentication mechanism has been re-designed and improved. 

| In old version (`com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`) | Equivalent in new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`) | Sample Link |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                                                |                                                            |      [link to existing sample](/)       |
|                                                |                                                            |             |
|                                                |                                                            |             |


## Migration Code Samples
* Migrating Azure **  to Azure **
* Migrating Authentication to AzureDefaultAuthentication 
* Migrating Iterable classes to PagedIterable classes
* Migrating xxx to xxx

### Migrating Azure **  to Azure **

In old version (`com.microsoft.azure-mgmt-**`), the classes are designed like this: xxxx
In new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`), the classes are re-designed like this: xxxx

So in old version (Code sample):
```java

OldClass class = new OldClass();

```


in new version (code sample)

```java

NewClass class = new NewClass();

```
